# mplough.github.io

This is the Jekyll repo for [mplough.github.io](https://mplough.github.io/).

## Local work

To do local work prior to pushes, I use `rbenv`.

Run `make setup` to install this project's Ruby version and all required Ruby gems.

Run `make serve` to run a local version of the blog.
