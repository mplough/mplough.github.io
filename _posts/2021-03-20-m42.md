title:  "First attempt at astrophotgraphy"
---

Equipped with a Celestron C5 on an inexpensive manual alt-azimuth mount (a
Celestron #93607), a 9mm X-Cel LX eyepiece, a smartphone adapter, and an
iPhone XR, I attempted to image M42, the Orion Nebula.

At 139x magnification the nebula moves fast so long exposures were out of the
question.  To get reasonably sharp stars I shot a 25-second 1920x1080 video at
24 frames/second with a 1/24 second exposure for each frame.  As I'm still
getting used to my equipment, I only shot light frames.  While it was clear in
advance that quantization and video compression artifacts would limit the
quality of such a technique, I wanted to understand what kind of results were
possible with this dirtiest of quick-and-dirty approaches.

I extracted the video with ffmpeg, resulting in 606 output frames:
```console
$ ffmpeg -i raw.MOV "out%d.png"
```

The first few frames showed camera shake from hitting record, so I discarded
them.  I then created a new [astrophotography
stack](http://www.weasner.com/co/Reviews/2021/AP/index.html) in [Affinity
Photo](https://affinityspotlight.com/article/major-advantages-of-astrophotography-stacking-in-affinity-photo/),
automatically selected the best 50% of light frames, and ran the stack.  The
iPhone's green pixels are the most sensitive so I got a nice greenish image
result, nothing a conversion to black-and-white won't cover up.  I then flipped
the result horizontally to correct the mirrored orientation due to my scope and
star diagonal.

While the nebula doesn't show up in great detail, I was surprised to see that
it did show up.  I was even more surprised to see an excellent presentation of
the Trapezium and even HD 36939, a 9th magnitude star.
