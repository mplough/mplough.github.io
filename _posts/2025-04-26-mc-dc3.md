title:  "Nikon MC-DC3 pinout"
---

The Nikon Z50II uses a new remote release cord, the
[MC-DC3](https://www.nikonusa.com/p/mc-dc3-remote-release-cord/27241/overview).
This cord plugs into the 3.5mm TRRS jack on the side of the camera.

### Pinout

The TRRS connection uses the [CTIA
standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#TRRS_standards).
The ground is on ring 2, not on the sleeve.

|Pin name|Remote|Audio|
|--------|------|-----|
|Tip|Release|Left|
|Ring 1|Focus|Right|
|Ring 2|Ground|Ground|
|Sleeve|Not connected|Microphone|

### Circuit

A 22 ohm resistor is wired in series between the switches and ground.  This
resistor is not required; the camera will focus and release even without it,
but the resistor may offer some protection to the camera if the TRRS jack is
left in [headphone mode](https://onlinemanual.nikonimglib.com/z50II/en/09-06-47.html) when the remote is connected and used.

To focus (equivalent to half-pressing the shutter release), close SW2 on Ring 1.
To release the shutter (equivalent to fully depressing the shutter release),
close SW2 first, then close SW1 on Tip.
